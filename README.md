# Previous-Codes
There are some codes from previous seasons.
I feel like my code is more well-written, but this code (not written by me) is more likely to have human understand it. Mine is like, meh, probably only a coding master who worked for more than 10 years in Java can understand it. It's not how complex I made it, but how abstract I named everything.
NVM, a few tips:
Every time, you may wanna keep the files named: Holonomic, DriveTrain, HolonomicFourWheelDrivetrain, Holonomic, Rotatable, Positionable, MecanumDrivertrain.
In case you don't wanna download them one-by-one, I kept them in one folder named "code you want every season."
